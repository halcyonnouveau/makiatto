# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support the most recent minor release train and will consider patches to prior versions depending on prevalence of the affected version(s) and severity of the reported issue. For example, if the most recent release is 0.24.1, we would provide a fix in a 0.24.x release, but we might not backport the fix to 0.23.x.
